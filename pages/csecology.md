This paper was the result of a collaboration between the ecology lab I worked in at Virginia Tech and a group of computer scientists stationed primarily at the University of Florida. We talk about some of the challenges and opportunities of working together, and some recommendations for the future. This was particularly exciting for me as both a biology and computer science major interested in environmental biology!
