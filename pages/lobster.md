In this work, we completed a number of radioactive uptake experiments on gill membrane vesicles that we made out of lobster gill membranes. The goal was to see whether hydrogen ions, which increase under conditions of ocean acidification, compete with calcium ions to be taken up by the gills of the lobster. This is important because it's through calcification that lobsters are protected from predators. Ocean acidification may interfere with the natural uptake of calcium for use in calcification by lobster gills and intestines.
