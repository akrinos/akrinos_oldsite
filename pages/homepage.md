Welcome to my brand new website! I am a Ph.D. student in Biological Oceanography in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. I am also a Computational Science Graduate Fellow
with the Department of Energy, meaning that during my career I will conduct a 12-week internship at a DOE lab. I am a proud graduate of Virginia Tech, and 
I consider myself an aquatic microbial ecologist. 

Thank you for visiting my website. It's just being built, but feel free to take a look around at what I have so far. Please don't hesitate to email me at akrinos@mit.edu
if you have any questions or just want to discuss!
